All of the files in this folder are apart of phpMyAdmin (http://www.phpmyadmin.net) and we claim no rights.
They have only been modified slightly to make them work as a module for Kohana.

Not all functionality will work, but we may add more later.
If you want more functionality that is apart of phpMyAdmin, either install the full version of phpMyAdmin.
